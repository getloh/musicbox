# Musicbox
This is an app made while following a guided project from codecademy's full stack developer course.
I'm not going to pretend I made it all, because I definitely didn't, but many of the aspects relating to fetching data from the spotify API, and displaying that data within the app were part of the material taught in the course.

## Usage
*This webapp will not work if you download it, as it is missing the API key.*
If you happen to have a spotify developer API key however, then throw it into 'musicbox\src\util\Spotify.js'
You can then run the app via npm start
